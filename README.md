# React-Redux Readable App built with react-hooks

This is the solution for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where you're required to build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.
