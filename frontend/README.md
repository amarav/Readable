# React-Redux Readable App built with react-hooks

This is the solution for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where you're required to build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.  

## Why this project?

Most application state is managed by the Redux store. State-based props are mapped from the store rather than stored as component state.Updates are triggered by dispatching action creators to reducers.Reducers and actions are written properly and correctly return updated state to the store
